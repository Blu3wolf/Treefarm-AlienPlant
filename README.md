# Treefarm-AlienPlant
Adds an Alien Plant to Treefarm. It can be used to make Alien Artifacts without killing biter spawner. To get the seeds you must kill first a few biterspawners and build a Alien Plant Foresty. In the Forestry you can make your first Alien Plant Seeds and convert Raw Alien Wood into Alien Artifacts and new Seeds.

Note:
-Alien Plants are growing very slow.
-You can't manually place alien seeds so you need at least the Farm MK1.
